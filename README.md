## WBC Training landing page

Static marketing page showcasing WBC Training programmes, bookings, and automation stack. The project is intentionally lightweight—there is no build tooling, just hand-authored HTML and CSS.

### Structure
- `WBC Training.html` – main markup, including hero, booking form, testimonials, automation stack, and the new immersive image showcase section.
- `styles.css` – all layout, typography, and component styling. Uses CSS custom properties for colors and spacing, plus responsive grid layouts.

### Preview locally
1. Double-click `WBC Training.html`, or open it from a browser via `File → Open`.
2. Ensure `styles.css` sits in the same directory so the stylesheet loads.

### Customising
- Replace the Unsplash image URLs in the `image-showcase` section with company photography.
- Update contact details, locations, or course listings directly in the HTML.
- Adjust colors or typography by editing the CSS variables at the top of `styles.css`.

### Credits
Fonts served via Google Fonts (`Space Grotesk`). Imagery taken from Unsplash placeholders—swap for owned assets before publishing.
